#FAQ

FAQ uses the list tool. The FAQ page uses a custom anchor list template while the rail module uses a custom simple list template.

One thing that needs to be updated everytime is the url on the rail module. The URL is hardcoded to where the location of the FAQ is.

##Examples 
Here are some examples of the FAQ in action. If the link doesn't work try -updates or update the link to live.
