#Sitemap

##CSS
Grab the _sitemap.scss partial and include it in main.scss. Everything should pull the styles automatically. If you need to change anything, first look at the variables at the top. Override these in main.scss for any style changes. If you need to change the layout outside of changing these variables, go ahead and change the partial.

##Code Template
Sitemap.ascx contains the Design Template for the Sitefinity widget. This will be used through a Sitefinity Navigation widget.
